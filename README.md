# New Job

You got a new job, and have to list all of your work in an easy to print format? This outputs some nice plain text for you.

## Setup / installation

 * `gem install bundler`
 * `bundle install`
 * `./projects.rb`

## Authentication

Options: 

 * Use a .netrc to set your username and password for your github account. Does not work if you have two factor auth enabled.
 * Or get an personal authentication code from https://github.com/settings/applications.
